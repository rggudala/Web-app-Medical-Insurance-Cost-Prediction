# Web-app-Medical-Insurance-Cost-Prediction
 Using PyCaret and Streamlit, build and deploy a Machine Learning web application for Medical Insurance Cost Prediction

Keypoints:

What is a deployment and why do we deploy machine learning models?

Develop a machine learning pipeline and train models using PyCaret.

Build a simple web app using a Streamlit open-source framework.

Deploy a web app on ‘Heroku’ and see the model in action.

Deploy Machine Learning Models

Setting the Business Context

To build a web application that supports online (one-by-one) as well as batch prediction using trained machine learning model and pipeline.

Train, validate and develop a machine learning pipeline using PyCaret.

Build a front-end web application with two functionalities: (i) online prediction and (ii) batch prediction.

Deploy the web app on Heroku. Once deployed, it will become publicly available and can be accessed via Web URL.
